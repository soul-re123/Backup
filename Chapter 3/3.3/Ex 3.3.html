	<h2><mark>Information Technology</mark></h2>
	<p>Information Technology (IT) continues to change the way we live, play, and do business, so it should come as no surprise that IT is this year's <em>fastest growing</em> career field, and will continue to be for <strong>years to come</strong>. The dominance of the IT job market is due in part to numerous factors, including prolific growth of the Internet and e-commerce, lower hardware and software prices allowing more businesses to upgrade their technology, increased demand for information security specialists spurred by the escalating frequency and sophistication of cyber-crimes, the advent of smarter applications enabling companies to analyze data and develop unprecedented business intelligence, and the dawn of the mobile computing era.</p>
	<p>For established IT professionals or those beginning an IT career path, this continues to be good news. However, despite rapid growth and increased opportunity, simply showing up will not guarantee success. The technology job market will continue to get more competitive as people go where the money and jobs are. This is why it's important to clearly identify your career objectives and develop a learning plan with the necessary skills, computer training and IT certifications to build a competitive edge and achieve your goals.</p>
	<p>Hopefully you enjoy creating websites because you will spend quite a bit of your day figuring out how to design and write the code behind the webpages. You will also learn how to write desktop and other types of applications. After 2 years of designing and coding, you will have many options. Programmers are in demand in most industries.</p>
